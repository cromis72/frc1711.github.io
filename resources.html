		<p>Git is used to interact with our repositories. You can use Git through the command line.</p>
		<li><a href="http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/">Ruby Installfest</a></li>
		<p>Ruby is another language that we may use in the offseason. This link leads you through the steps necessary to get started with Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. While this is completely optional, it is recommended if you want to participate in a broader range of offseason projects.</p>
